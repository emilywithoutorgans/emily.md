# 1844 manuscripts

## introduction

The *Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844* are basically Marx's first shot at critiquing bourgeois political economy.

There are three manuscripts. Only the last four pages of the second survive. The first manuscript integrates rather a lot of bourgeois political economy, so this only represents thoughts of early Marx and not the apex of Marx.

All three manuscripts are mainly about **estrangement of labor** and **alienation of the laborer** in capitalist society. 

"Estrangement" and "alienation" refer to "the appropriation by the capitalist of the product of a worker's labor" and "the separation of the worker from the means of production" which essentially functions as an enslaving power to the worker.

Marx shows that the more wealth a worker produces, the poorer they become. He further claims that this will inevitably lead to revolution, then to workers' emancipation, and, by extension, "universal human emancipation".

## wages of labor

Wages are the product of struggle between the capitalist in the worker. However, the capitalist always wins due to the fact that the capitalist is much less dependent on the worker than the worker is dependent on the capitalist.

Furthermore, capitalists are allowed to group and collectively make decisions to further their interests. The same cannot be said for workers (e.g. workers' unions).

Workers usually only has a singular source of income: industrial income, while landowners and capitalists have additional sources of income such as ground-rent and interest on capital to sustain themselves.

This is the source of competition among workers. This puts them in a unique (and precarious) position: workers only have their labor to subsist off of, as they do not own capital and landed property. It is, in this sense, "fatal" to the worker.

### necessary wage

The only necessary wage for a capitalist to pay a worker is the lowest: that which is sufficient for 

1. the subsistence of the worker for the duration of their work and 

2. additionally, the subsistence of their family, in order to maintain a sufficient reserve of workers.

*The ordinary wage, according to Smith, is the lowest compatible with common humanity (that is a cattle-like existence).*

### "demand for men"

It's logical to consider "men" as a commodity itself that is produced to various degrees.

If the supply of men greatly exceed the supply, the "extraneous men" become poor, homeless, and starving. 

So, first, in the event of a worker surplus, wages are pushed down by virtue of the market.

Secondly, when profit (price-profit) or rent (ground-rent) take a hit, the effect is usually propagated to wages because workers have the least bargaining power.

The worker is effectively a commodity that must search for a buyer. The worker's life *depends* on the rich and capitalists.

The more unemployed people there are, the more capitalists are able to keep wages low.

### workers are disadvantaged in many ways

Division of labor (DOL) makes it difficult for workers to switch gears into a different industry. They are confined to some particular branch of labor. 

Capitalists don't have this problem quite as much. They can redirect their capital to produce products in another industry on a whim. Workers are subordinate to the demands of the capitalist.

#### fluctuations in the market

Since the worker is subordinated to purchase by capitalists, the worker is set up to lose the most in the case of a surplus of workers or a market downturn.

Fluctuations in the market affect rent less than profit, and profit is affected less than wages. Marx presents wages as zero-sum, where a rise in one wage is most often accompanied by a fall in some other.

#### asymmetry

Workers do not necessarily gain when the capitalist gains, but workers necessarily lose when the capitalist loses.

#### when food is expensive

Wages go up because workers need more money for basic necessities. However, wages also go down because demand for labor drops; businesses struggle with high costs. Nothing changes.

#### when food is cheap

When food is cheap, wages go up because businesses need more labor. However, wages also drop because the cost of living is lower, so capitalists can get away with paying less. Nothing ever changes.

In any case, some workers are paid below what they need and they live in poverty.

#### wages are incredibly varied

Between different occupations and kinds of labor, there are huge differences in wages due to extremely hard-to-control factors such as where the worker was born, their education, whether their job is "valued" by the market, etc.

Profit is relatively stable and predictable regardless of the industry. Capital (money-capital included), really doesn't care. If you're smart about it, it just sits there and increases, it reproduces and multiplies.

### the position of the worker in society

Not only that, when they have a job, the worker has to struggle for their subsistence. When they don't have a job, workers have to struggle for a job.

#### if societal wealth declines

The worker suffers the most, for reasons we've already outlined.

#### if societal wealth increases

This seems good for the worker. Competition between capitalists sets in, demand for workers is higher than supply. 

Furthermore, rising wages create overwork, since "the raising of wages excites in the worker the capitalist's mania to get rich, which they, however, can only satisfy by the sacrifice of his mind and body". This shortens the lifespan of workers, and this is favorable to the working class because supply of labor needs more maintenance. As Marx writes, "This class has always to sacrifice a part of itself in order not to be wholly destroyed".

#### wait, but why is wealth increasing?

**1. Increasing surplus value extraction.** This is possible through the accumulation of labor. Since labor is capital, thus the accumulation of capital. Workers are being isolated from the products of their labor at ever-increasing rates. Workers' reliance on capitalists increases.

**2. DOL feedback loop.** The more capital is accumulated (capitalists reinvest their profits), the more businesses push for division of labor (to maximize productivity). Division of labor, in turn, increases the number of workers needed because jobs are fragmented and more people can be slotted into the system. Marx also writes that the worker is "depressed spiritually and physically to the condition of a machine". Competition between workers then increases and wages drop. 

**3. Top capitalists no longer have to bother.** As society gets richer, only the ultra-rich can afford just living off interest. Every other capitalist has to actually put their money to work by running businesses (business owners) or trading (small-time investors). Competition between capitalists then heats up. 

**Capitalist competition.** However, competition in this game is by no means fair. Well-established capitalists crush the little guys through more resources, better economies of scale, and can afford to operate at a loss to sabotage competitors. Small capitalists lose everything and fall back into the working class. No more capitalist competition.

**Wages drop even further.** More workers means less wages means more competition. More dependence on the few surviving mega-capitalists. If you don't have enough wealth to escape the gravity of the working class, you get sucked back in. More workers also means more people falling into poverty and destitution.

#### superb outcome for the worker /s

The outcome of this system for the worker is "overwork and premature death, decline to a mere machine, servitude to capital piling up against them, more competition, and more poverty".

In short:

1. More wages = more capital accumulation, which is used against the worker.

2. More division of labor = more machine-like labor and dependence on the capitalist, increasing worker competition and even competition with machines.

3. More capital accumulation = more industry = more workers, meaning overproduction and increasing unemployment or decreasing wages.

And, mind you, Marx notes that this is the *best* outcome for the worker: a society of growing wealth.
