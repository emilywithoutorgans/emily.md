# 1844 manuscripts

## introduction

The *Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844* are basically Marx's first shot at critiquing bourgeois political economy.

There are three manuscripts. Only the last four pages of the second survive. The first manuscript integrates rather a lot of bourgeois political economy, so this only represents thoughts of early Marx and not the apex of Marx.

All three manuscripts are mainly about **estrangement of labor** and **alienation of the laborer** in capitalist society. 

"Estrangement" and "alienation" refer to "the appropriation by the capitalist of the product of a worker's labor" and "the separation of the worker from the means of production" which essentially functions as an enslaving power to the worker.

Marx shows that the more wealth a worker produces, the poorer they become. He further claims that this will inevitably lead to revolution, then to workers' emancipation, and, by extension, "universal human emancipation".

## wages of labor: first manuscript

Wages are the product of struggle between the capitalist and the worker. However, the capitalist always wins due to the fact that the capitalist is much less dependent on the worker than the worker is dependent on the capitalist.

Furthermore, capitalists are allowed to group and collectively make decisions to further their interests. The same cannot be said for workers (e.g. workers' unions).

Workers usually only has a singular source of income: industrial income, while landowners and capitalists have additional sources of income such as ground-rent and interest on capital to sustain themselves.

This is the source of competition among workers. This puts them in a unique (and precarious) position: workers only have their labor to subsist off of, as they do not own capital and landed property. It is, in this sense, "fatal" to the worker.

### necessary wage

The only necessary wage for a capitalist to pay a worker is the lowest: that which is sufficient for 

1. the subsistence of the worker for the duration of their work and 

2. additionally, the subsistence of their family, in order to maintain a sufficient reserve of workers.

*The ordinary wage, according to Smith, is the lowest compatible with common humanity (that is a cattle-like existence).*

### "demand for men"

It's logical to consider "men" as a commodity itself that is produced to various degrees.

If the supply of men greatly exceed the supply, the "extraneous men" become poor, homeless, and starving. 

So, first, in the event of a worker surplus, wages are pushed down by virtue of the market.

Secondly, when profit (price-profit) or rent (ground-rent) take a hit, the effect is usually propagated to wages because workers have the least bargaining power.

The worker is effectively a commodity that must search for a buyer. The worker's life *depends* on the rich and capitalists.

The more unemployed people there are, the more capitalists are able to keep wages low.

### workers are disadvantaged in many ways

Division of labor (DOL) makes it difficult for workers to switch gears into a different industry. They are confined to some particular branch of labor. 

Capitalists don't have this problem quite as much. They can redirect their capital to produce products in another industry on a whim. Workers are subordinate to the demands of the capitalist.

#### fluctuations in the market

Since the worker is subordinated to purchase by capitalists, the worker is set up to lose the most in the case of a surplus of workers or a market downturn.

Fluctuations in the market affect rent less than profit, and profit is affected less than wages. Marx presents wages as zero-sum, where a rise in one wage is most often accompanied by a fall in some other.

#### asymmetry

Workers do not necessarily gain when the capitalist gains, but workers necessarily lose when the capitalist loses.

#### when food is expensive

Wages go up because workers need more money for basic necessities. However, wages also go down because demand for labor drops; businesses struggle with high costs. Nothing changes.

#### when food is cheap

When food is cheap, wages go up because businesses need more labor. However, wages also drop because the cost of living is lower, so capitalists can get away with paying less. Nothing ever changes.

In any case, some workers are paid below what they need and they live in poverty.

#### wages are incredibly varied

Between different occupations and kinds of labor, there are huge differences in wages due to extremely hard-to-control factors such as where the worker was born, their education, whether their job is "valued" by the market, etc.

Profit is relatively stable and predictable regardless of the industry. Capital (money-capital included), really doesn't care. If you're smart about it, it just sits there and increases, it reproduces and multiplies.

### the position of the worker in society

Not only that, when they have a job, the worker has to struggle for their subsistence. When they don't have a job, workers have to struggle for a job.

#### if societal wealth declines

The worker suffers the most, for reasons we've already outlined.

#### if societal wealth increases

This seems good for the worker. Competition between capitalists sets in, demand for workers is higher than supply. 

Furthermore, rising wages create overwork, since "the raising of wages excites in the worker the capitalist's mania to get rich, which they, however, can only satisfy by the sacrifice of his mind and body". This shortens the lifespan of workers, and this is favorable to the working class because supply of labor needs more maintenance. As Marx writes, "This class has always to sacrifice a part of itself in order not to be wholly destroyed".

#### wait, but why is wealth increasing?

**1. Increasing surplus value extraction.** This is possible through the accumulation of labor. Since labor is capital, thus the accumulation of capital. Workers are being isolated from the products of their labor at ever-increasing rates. Workers' reliance on capitalists increases.

**2. DOL feedback loop.** The more capital is accumulated (capitalists reinvest their profits), the more businesses push for division of labor (to maximize productivity). Division of labor, in turn, increases the number of workers needed because jobs are fragmented and more people can be slotted into the system. Marx also writes that the worker is "depressed spiritually and physically to the condition of a machine". Competition between workers then increases and wages drop. 

**3. Top capitalists no longer have to bother.** As society gets richer, only the ultra-rich can afford just living off interest. Every other capitalist has to actually put their money to work by running businesses (business owners) or trading (small-time investors). Competition between capitalists then heats up. 

**Capitalist competition.** However, competition in this game is by no means fair. Well-established capitalists crush the little guys through more resources, better economies of scale, and can afford to operate at a loss to sabotage competitors. Small capitalists lose everything and fall back into the working class. No more capitalist competition.

**Wages drop even further.** More workers means less wages means more competition. More dependence on the few surviving mega-capitalists. If you don't have enough wealth to escape the gravity of the working class, you get sucked back in. More workers also means more people falling into poverty and destitution.

#### superb outcome for the worker /s

The outcome of this system for the worker is "overwork and premature death, decline to a mere machine, servitude to capital piling up against them, more competition, and more poverty".

In short:

1. More wages = more capital accumulation, which is used against the worker.

2. More division of labor = more machine-like labor and dependence on the capitalist, increasing worker competition and even competition with machines.

3. More capital accumulation = more industry = more workers, meaning overproduction and either increasing unemployment or decreasing wages.

And, mind you, Marx notes that this is the *best* outcome for the worker: a society of growing wealth.

#### growth ain't forever

What happens when wages are so low they're insufficient for the number of workers in the market?

The surplus workers die. Literally.

Marx sums it up as follows:

In a declining society (e.g. economic collapse, crisis, war), worker misery increases. 

In a thriving society (e.g. industries expanding, wealth creation, capital accumulation), workers suffer in more "complicated" ways as described above. 

In a stagnant/peaked society, worker misery becomes static.

### misery is the goal

According to Smith, a society is *not happy*. Most people suffer. Marx states that even the wealthiest state of society leads to most people suffering. Since the goal of the economic system is this wealthiest state, Marx contends that part of the goal of the economic system is the unhappiness of society.

### how the capitalist is affected by wage increase

The capitalist is usually unaffected by worker wage increases, since they find ways to cut labor time (decrease total payout), increase efficiency, automate tasks, or push workers harder. The worker might have higher wages, but they're likely doing the same amount (or more) of work in less time, meaning their gains are practically zero.

When wages go up, prices of goods rise *linearly* (like simple interest). But when capitalists demand a higher return on investment (higher interest on capital), that stacks up like compound interest due to reproduction of capital, meaning it accumulates way faster than wages ever could.

Capitalists are cranking up profits exponentially while workers play a slow, losing game.

### political economists vs. reality

The political economist claims that, in theory, the product of labor belongs to the worker. In reality however, the worker only really gets what is necessary for 

1. their existence not as a person, but *as a worker*, and

2. "the propagation, not of humanity, but of the slave-class of workers".

In theory, everything is bought with labor, and capital is just accumulated labor. Implicitly, workers should be the real owners of everything, since they are the source of labor. In reality however, the people who actually do the labor don't get to enjoy the wealth they generate. They're handing over autonomy, creativity, and dignity. Their obedience, time, and the right to control their own lives.

In theory, labor is sacred, but in reality, capitalists keep dangling the carrot on a stick and ensuring that laborers themselves remain moneyless and powerless. While landowners and capitalists sit on their asses collecting wealth like they're only responsible for the maintenance of the money-machine, workers, who supposedly create all value, barely make enough to keep their families alive. The people who do the least get the most, and the people who do the most get nothing but misery.

In theory, labor has the most constant measure of value, but in reality, wages have the greatest fluctuations out of any exchange.

In theory, the interests of the worker are never in opposition with society, because

1. even if wages go up, it's supposedly "balanced out" by reducing labor time and other adjustments.

2. when looking at society as a whole, there's no real distinction between "gross product" and "net product" (the profit that remains after wages and costs).

Here's Marx's line of argument:

First, he identifies the usual story as saying that "wages are what's left after rent and profit are taken out", like capitalists "deduct" their share from revenue.

This is backwards. The worker doesn't start with 100% of the wealth and then have pieces taken away. The capitalist starts with all of it and wages are justa small fraction they *allow* the worker to keep so they don't drop dead before the next shift.

When society is falling apart, the worker suffers the most, because they're already living on the edge. They have no safety net, no reserves, no passive income, just their labor, which is the first thing to be devalued. This is a general burden in living in society, but the specific misery of the worker comes from their dependence on labor.

Even when society is improving, the worker still gets screwed. The wealth they create doesn't liberate them, but in fact exacerbates their exploitation. The more production, the more surplus value, the more of an asset they are to capitalists. 

When society reaches peak wealth, the worker is trapped in a state of "frozen misery". Endless work, never moving up, surviving without living.

It's interesting how, here, Marx used the word **proletarian** for defining the whole human being of the worker, even outside of work. Political economists only consider workers as cogs in the machine, not remotely as human beings outside of the work they do.

When the worker isn't working, they become someone else's problem. The legal system watches them like a potential criminal. Doctors patch them up if they're broken. Religion tells them to accept their suffering and provides them with meaning. Statisticians reduce their misery to numbers. Politicians throw them slogans and something to care about, even if it's fake. And when none of that works, they're dumped in the poorhouse or prison.

There's no space for the worker as a person. It only acknowledges them as long as they're profitable. The moment they aren't, they're either ignored or discarded.

### based on the above

Marx proposes to answer two questions that political economists got so close to articulating:

1. What's the historical significance of turning people into pure economic units? (reduction of humanity into **abstract labor**, labor stripped of individuality, an input measured in hours, productivity, and wages)

2. What are the mistakes of reformists who think higher wages or wage equality will fix things?

Marx also notes that "in political economy, labor only exists as a *wage-earning activity*". It only recognizes labor that can be bought and sold. It ignores all the unpaid, creative, and self-directed labor that people do outside of the economic system.

Marx quotes a passage from Wilhelm Schulz's *Movement of Production* which states that, 

1. if an extremely small subsection of workers experiences a wage increases, on average, worker wages have increased. This is a common way to mislead using statistics.

2. in addition, wage size is not enough to consider; one must also consider how *permanent* the value of that wage is, since capitalism in competition is such a volatile system, and the *hours of work*, which are by no means guaranteed to decrease with "the introduction of labor-saving machines".

Another passage from the same source again refutes the "rising tide lifts all boats" proverb in saying that

1. Even if the absolute amount of wealth per person increases, the relative gap between rich and poor can still get worse, and it's this latter measure that actually determines people's quality of life. Your income can grow while you're effectively *falling behind* even if you have more money than before.

2. Poor is a relative measure. The worker who makes the same wage after ten years isn't staying stable, they're losing ground. Lower buying power, opportunities, place in society. They become poorer relative to everyone else.

### abstract labor

Abstract labor is a commodity, just like corn, steel, or oil. Its price (wages) is dictated by supply and demand, not by any recognition of human dignity or needs.

If wages are high, it means labor is scarce, so capitalists have to compete to buy it. If wages are low, it means there are too many desperate workers willing to sell themselves, so capitalists can pay them scraps.

Over time, wages must falll ower and lower because two forces are constantly driving them down:

1. If the capitalist can cut wages without causing a revolt, they will.

2. Since most people *must* work to survive, they'll underbid each other just to get *any* job, forcing wages even lower.

They'll also hire women and children because they're cheaper than men. Women, under the patriarchy, were expected to accept lower wages.

Eugène Buret, in his "De la misère..." stresses that the capitalist always has the power to walk away, while the worker must sell their labor or starve. If the worker doesn't sell their labor every single day, they lose everything. Labor is tied to human life.

If a factory owner can't sell steel today, they can store it and sell it later. A worker, on the other hand, if they don't work today, they don't eat today.

If labor is a commodity, then **human life itself is a commodity.** If your survival depends on being bought and sold, you're not "freely" selling labor, you're just a modernized version of a slave. The only difference is, instead of being owned outright, you're beg to be rented by the hour.

Labor isn't really a commodity, though. A real commodity is something that's freely traded between equal parties. However, this relationship more amounts to extortion than a transaction. Ultimately, the system "perfects the worker" from the perspective of the capitalist and "degrades the man" behind the worker. Labor also cannot be accumulated or saved. "Labor is life, and if life is not each day exchanged for food, it suffers and soon perishes".
